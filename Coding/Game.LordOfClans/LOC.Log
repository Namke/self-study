  Adding computer AI - very simple
  Fixed some error when switch between other command
  Sometime when testing - I don't know exact when - Unit lost command (when at command Attack [12]) and
stand. I think it because AIPlayer repeated send command when last command under running then I made
AIPlayer only send command for unit has no command, but maybe that occur with human player ? That error I
don't know.
